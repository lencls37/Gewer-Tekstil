                        p A style is not just about keeping up with the trending fashion or buying expensive clothes. The style is, in fact, a reflection of your own personality and inner mind and it has little to do with appearance. Being well-dressed doesnâ€™t mean we have a style. It means you pay attention to your looks. But if others say they can see your style, it means you have a hallmark.
